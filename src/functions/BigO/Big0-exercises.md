1. What is the Big O for this?

1) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"

ANSWER: 0(1)-> let dog= dogs[breed]

2) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You start with the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever. He says no, then you ask the next person, and the next, and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there is no one else to ask.

ANSWER: 0(n)-> let dog= dogs.find(dog=>dog.breed==='golden retriever') (n is a random number)

11. Tower of Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a very famous mathematical puzzle (some call it game!). This is how it goes:

There are three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks neatly stacked in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest disk at the top (making a conical shape). The other two rods are empty to begin with.
The goal of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of rods to another rod (can't be the original rod where it was stacked before) where it will be stacked in the ascending order as well. This should be done obeying the following rules: i) Only one disk may be moved at a time ii) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod. iii) A larger disk may not placed on top of a smaller disk
Input:

Rod A	Rod B	Rod C
----		
---------		
-------------		
Output:

Rod A	Rod B	Rod C
----
---------
-------------
Derive an algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
Implement your algorithm using recursion. Your program should display each movement of the disk from one rod to another.
If you are given 5 disks, how do the rods look like after 7 recursive calls?
How many moves are needed to complete the puzzle with 3 disks? with 4 disks? with 5 disks?
What is the runtime of your algorithm?*/

12. Iterative version
Solve the drills 1 - 7 from your previous checkpoint (Recursion) iteratively.*/


13. Recursive Big O
Take your solutions from the recursive exercises that you completed in the previous checkpoint and identify the time complexities (big O) of each of them.

14. Iterative Big O
Take your solutions from the iterative exercises today and identify the time complexities (big O) of each of them.
